K8s external provider
==============================

General information
------------------------------

Cert Service K8s external provider is a part of certificate distribution infrastructure in ONAP.
The main functionality of the provider is to forward Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) created by cert-mananger (https://cert-manager.io) to CertServiceAPI.

Additional information can be found on a dedicated page:  https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/CertService+and+K8s+Cert-Manager+integration.


CMPv2 Issuer
------------------------------

In order to be able to request a certificate via K8s external provider a *CMPv2Issuer* CRD (Customer Resource Definition) instance has to be created.

It is important to note that the attribute *kind* has to be set to **CMPv2Issuer**, all other attributes can be set as needed.

NOTE: a default instance of CMPv2Issuer is created when installing ONAP via OOM deployment (values can also be adjusted as needed)

Here is an example of a *CMPv2Issuer*:

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: certmanager.onap.org/v1
  kind: CMPv2Issuer
  metadata:
    name: cmpv2-issuer
    namespace: onap
  spec:
    url: https://oom-cert-service:8443
    healthEndpoint: actuator/health
    certEndpoint: v1/certificate
    caName: RA
    certSecretRef:
      name: cmpv2-issuer-secret
      certRef: cmpv2Issuer-cert.pem
      keyRef: cmpv2Issuer-key.pem
      cacertRef: cacert.pem


Certificate enrolling
------------------------------

In order to request a certificate a K8s *Certificate* CRD (Custom Resource Definition) has to be created.

It is important that in the section issuerRef following attributes have correct values:
  - group: **certmanager.onap.org**
  - kind: **CMPv2Issuer**

After *Certificate* CRD has been placed cert manager will send a *CSR* (Certificate Sign Request) to CA (Certificate Authority) via K8s external provider.
Signed certificate as well as trust anchor (CA root certificate) will be stored in the K8s *secret* specified in *Certificate* CRD (see secretName attribute).

By default certificates will be stored in PEM format. It is possible to get certificates also in JKS and P12 format - see example below - more information can be found on official cert manager page.

The following SANs types are supported: DNS names, IPs, URIs, emails.

Here is an example of a *Certificate*:

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: Certificate
  metadata:
    name: certificate_name
    namespace: onap
  spec:
    # The secret name to store the signed certificate
    secretName: secret_name
    # Common Name
    commonName: certissuer.onap.org
    subject:
      organizations:
        - Linux-Foundation
      countries:
        - US
      localities:
        - San-Francisco
      provinces:
        - California
      organizationalUnits:
        - ONAP
    # SANs
    dnsNames:
      - localhost
      - certissuer.onap.org
    ipAddresses:
      - "127.0.0.1"
    uris:
      - onap://cluster.local/
    emailAddresses:
      - onap@onap.org
    # The reference to the CMPv2 issuer
    issuerRef:
      group: certmanager.onap.org
      kind: CMPv2Issuer
      name: cmpv2-issuer
    # Section keystores is optional and defines in which format certificates will be stored
    # If this section is omitted than only PEM format will be present in the secret
    keystores:
        jks:
          create: true
          passwordSecretRef: # Password used to encrypt the keystore
            name: certservice-key
            key: key
        pkcs12:
          create: true
          passwordSecretRef: # Password used to encrypt the keystore
            name: certservice-key
            key: key


Here is an example of generated *secret* containing certificates:

.. code-block:: yaml

    Name:         secret_name
    Namespace:    onap
    Labels:       <none>
    Annotations:  cert-manager.io/alt-names: localhost,certissuer.onap.org
                  cert-manager.io/certificate-name: certificate_name
                  cert-manager.io/common-name: certissuer.onap.org
                  cert-manager.io/ip-sans:
                  cert-manager.io/issuer-group: certmanager.onap.org
                  cert-manager.io/issuer-kind: CMPv2Issuer
                  cert-manager.io/issuer-name: cmpv2-issuer-onap
                  cert-manager.io/uri-sans:
