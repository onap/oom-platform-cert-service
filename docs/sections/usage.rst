How to use functionality
=========================
Common information to docker and Kubernetes modes described below

Basic information
-----------------
CertService client needs the following configuration parameters to work properly:

1. Parameters for generating certification artifacts and connecting to CertService API to obtain certificate and trust anchors
  
  - REQUEST_URL *(default: https://oom-cert-service:8443/v1/certificate/)* - URL to CertService API
  - REQUEST_TIMEOUT *(default: 30000[ms])* - Timeout in milliseconds for REST API calls
  - OUTPUT_PATH *(required)* - Path where client will output generated certificate and trust anchor
  - CA_NAME *(required)* - Name of CA which will enroll certificate. Must be same as configured on server side. Used in REST API calls
  - OUTPUT_TYPE *(default: P12)* - Type of certificate which will be generated. Supported types: 
      
      - JKS - Java KeyStore (JKS)
      - P12 - Public Key Cryptography Standard #12 (PKCS#12)
      - PEM - Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM)


2. Parameters to generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
  
  - COMMON_NAME *(required)* - Common name for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - ORGANIZATION *(required)* - Organization for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - ORGANIZATION_UNIT *(optional)* - Organization unit for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - LOCATION *(optional)* - Location for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - STATE *(required)* - State for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - COUNTRY *(required)* - Country for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued
  - SANS *(optional)(SANS's should be separated by a comma e.g. test.onap.org,onap.com)* - Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for which certificate from CMPv2 server should be issued.

3. Parameters to establish secure communication to CertService:

  - KEYSTORE_PATH *(required)*
  - KEYSTORE_PASSWORD *(required)*
  - TRUSTSTORE_PATH *(required)*
  - TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD *(required)*

CertService client image can be found on Nexus repository :

.. code-block:: bash

  nexus3.onap.org:10001/onap/org.onap.oom.platform.cert-service.oom-certservice-client:$VERSION


As standalone docker container
------------------------------
You need certificate and trust anchors to connect to CertService API via HTTPS. Information how to generate truststore and keystore files you can find in project repository README `Gerrit GitWeb <https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=oom%2Fplatform%2Fcert-service.git;a=summary>`__

To run CertService client as standalone docker container execute following steps:

1. Create file '*$PWD/client.env*' with environment variables as in example below:

.. code-block:: bash

  #Client envs
  REQUEST_URL=<URL to CertService API>
  REQUEST_TIMEOUT=10000
  OUTPUT_PATH=/var/certs
  CA_NAME=RA
  OUTPUT_TYPE=P12

  #CSR config envs
  COMMON_NAME=onap.org
  ORGANIZATION=Linux-Foundation
  ORGANIZATION_UNIT=ONAP
  LOCATION=San-Francisco
  STATE=California
  COUNTRY=US
  SANS=test.onap.org,onap.com

  #TLS config envs
  KEYSTORE_PATH=/etc/onap/oom/certservice/certs/certServiceClient-keystore.jks
  KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password to certServiceClient-keystore.jks>
  TRUSTSTORE_PATH=/etc/onap/oom/certservice/certs/certServiceClient-truststore.jks
  TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=<password to certServiceClient-truststore.jks>

2. Run docker container as in following example (API and client must be running in same network):

.. code-block:: bash

 docker run \
    --rm \
    --name oomcert-client \
    --env-file <$PWD/client.env (same as in step1)> \
    --network <docker network of cert service> \
    --mount type=bind,src=<path to local host directory where certificate and trust anchor will be created>,dst=<OUTPUT_PATH (same as in step 1)> \
    --volume <local path to keystore in JKS format>:<KEYSTORE_PATH> \
    --volume <local path to truststore in JKS format>:<TRUSTSTORE_PATH> \
    nexus3.onap.org:10001/onap/org.onap.oom.platform.cert-service.oom-certservice-client:$VERSION



After successful creation of certifications, container exits with exit code 0, expected log looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

If container exits with non 0 exit code, you can find more information in logs, see :ref:`cert_logs` page.

As init container for Kubernetes
--------------------------------

In order to run CertService client as init container for ONAP component you need to:

    - define an init container and use CerService Client image
    - provide client configuration through ENV variables in the init container
    - define two volumes:

        - first for generated certificates - it will be mounted in the init container and in the component container
        - second with secret containing keys and certificates for secure communication between CertService Client and CertService - it will be mounted only in the init container
    - mount both volumes to the init container
    - mount first volume to the component container

You can use the following deployment example as a reference:
